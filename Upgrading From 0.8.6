Version 0.8.8 contains a fix that significantly improves startup time. The fix involves adding a field to the TX database. This makes the version 0.8.6 TX database incompatible with this version.


********
One will need to delete the txleveldb directory from the datadir directory. When client/daemon version 0.8.8 is started up, it will then redownload the blockchain in order to reconstruct the TX database.

If one does not delete the txleveldb directory, version 0.8.8 will not be able to start.

********


The datadir is stored:

Linux: ~/.darsek

Windows: C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Darsek

ONLY THE TXLEVELDB DIRECTORY NEEDS TO BE DELETED, THE REST OF THE DIRECTORY CAN STAY.
